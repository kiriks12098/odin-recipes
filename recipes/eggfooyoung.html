        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Egg foo youg is a Chinese American dish similar to an omelette. 
            The dish consists primarily of egg, cabbage and onion with an optional meat added. 
            The omlette is fried in oil and then is usually topped with a brown gravy.</p>

            <p>It is common for some Chinese restaurants to serve the brown gravy on the side, 
                but I've always prefered to have the omelette resting in a dish containing the gravy.
